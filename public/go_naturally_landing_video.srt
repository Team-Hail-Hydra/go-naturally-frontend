1
00:00:05,838 --> 00:00:08,398
Right now, we're facing a man-made

2
00:00:08,398 --> 00:00:10,839
disaster of global

3
00:00:10,839 --> 00:00:13,479
scale, our greatest threat in

4
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:16,399
thousands of years, climate

5
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:16,759
change.

6
00:00:20,439 --> 00:00:23,399
If we don't take action, the collapse

7
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:26,240
of our civilizations and the

8
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,080
extinction of much of the natural world

9
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:30,920
is on the horizon.

10
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,520
The world's people have spoken.

11
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,401
Their message is clear.

12
00:00:40,921 --> 00:00:42,681
Time is running out.

13
00:00:44,761 --> 00:00:46,721
The amount of carbon dioxide in the

14
00:00:46,721 --> 00:00:49,641
atmosphere now is 50% higher

15
00:00:49,961 --> 00:00:52,681
than it was in 1900. And not

16
00:00:52,681 --> 00:00:54,842
only are we piling in more and more

17
00:00:54,842 --> 00:00:57,682
carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. But we

18
00:00:57,682 --> 00:00:59,722
are chopping down the forests of the

19
00:00:59,722 --> 00:01:02,682
earth at a great rate. And the forests

20
00:01:02,682 --> 00:01:04,762
themselves are the most efficient

21
00:01:04,762 --> 00:01:07,602
consumers of carbon dioxide than

22
00:01:07,602 --> 00:01:10,283
there are on earth. We're going to

23
00:01:10,283 --> 00:01:13,243
destroy the ground because the soil

24
00:01:13,243 --> 00:01:15,723
of a rainforest isn't very good. We are

25
00:01:15,723 --> 00:01:18,323
actually tampering with the climate of

26
00:01:18,323 --> 00:01:20,363
the earth and with the very atmosphere

27
00:01:20,363 --> 00:01:23,004
that we breathe. When we

28
00:01:23,004 --> 00:01:25,964
talk about the disappearance of the ozone

29
00:01:25,964 --> 00:01:28,604
layer,We don't know what will

30
00:01:28,604 --> 00:01:30,684
happen when the ozone layer goes.

31
00:01:32,124 --> 00:01:34,124
The world has become so fragile

32
00:01:35,164 --> 00:01:38,005
that we cannot subject the earth to the

33
00:01:38,045 --> 00:01:40,365
tortures we can now inflict upon it.

34
00:01:41,765 --> 00:01:44,445
When we talk about the greenhouse effect,

35
00:01:44,845 --> 00:01:47,405
we're talking about something that

36
00:01:47,405 --> 00:01:49,285
affects the entire earth.

37
00:01:50,525 --> 00:01:52,606
And these problems are life and death

38
00:01:52,686 --> 00:01:55,566
problems. They go to the root of the

39
00:01:55,566 --> 00:01:58,206
viability of the planet itself.

40
00:02:19,888 --> 00:02:21,328
See, if there's one thing that is

41
00:02:21,328 --> 00:02:24,208
biologically certain about

42
00:02:24,208 --> 00:02:26,968
the human species is that it is a

43
00:02:27,528 --> 00:02:29,648
human species, one

44
00:02:29,728 --> 00:02:32,528
species. If we

45
00:02:32,528 --> 00:02:35,089
don't stop the destruction of our natural

46
00:02:35,089 --> 00:02:37,009
world, nothing else will matter.

47
00:02:39,889 --> 00:02:42,369
Simply put, if we don't protect

48
00:02:42,369 --> 00:02:45,249
nature, we can't protect

49
00:02:45,249 --> 00:02:45,809
ourselves.

50
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:00,210
The only way we can solve a problem

51
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:03,731
is by a human solution.

52
00:03:04,211 --> 00:03:06,771
Never can we sit back and wait for

53
00:03:06,771 --> 00:03:09,491
miracles to save us. Miracles

54
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:12,211
don't happen. Sweat happens.

55
00:03:12,611 --> 00:03:14,931
Efforts happens. Thought

56
00:03:15,091 --> 00:03:15,891
happens.
